# critwire Learn: a practitioner curriculum (design)

Design for critwire Learn as a practitioner course in database architecture, GIS in SQL, spatial statistics, ETL and Power BI, taught on critwire's open species data and other open data. It starts from a little SQL and everyday GIS, covers the foundations fast, then goes deep. It replaces the course in `plans/002-learn.md` and `plans/003-learn-data-spatial.md` and reuses their engine, schema, data and licensing findings (§1). Every SQL and Python block here is tested (§0). Nothing public changes until the build missions in §9 run.

Written by mission `critwire-learn-curriculum` (plan `plans/2026-10-23-critwire-learn-curriculum.md`); a section marked "(S<n>)" is written by that plan's step S<n>.

## 0. Conventions

How blocks are labelled, which engine runs them and how to re-run them (S13).

### The browser setup

The browser labs (DuckDB-WASM) start from 002's database plus the lab sample: this `setup` block, the spike's `src/setup.sql`, runs at boot. Its first part is 002's `setup` byte for byte (schema v1); schema v2 adds `datasets` and `occurrences`, read from `/learn/data/datasets.csv` and `/learn/data/occurrences.parquet` (§4). It has no result block.

```sql
-- q: setup
-- status: ran
-- critwire Learn: the learners' tables (schema v1), built on a fresh in-memory database
-- from /v1/species.parquet and /v1/countries.parquet. Every table a foreign key points at is
-- created first, and taxa go in one rank per INSERT, top down: DuckDB declares foreign keys
-- only in CREATE TABLE and checks them statement by statement. Nothing is ever dropped;
-- a fresh database comes from a restart.

```

The row count of every table and of the view (`countries` is A1's draft of `/v1/countries`; `datasets` and `occurrences` are the lab sample, §4):

```sql
-- q: setup-counts
-- status: ran
SELECT (SELECT count(*) FROM taxa)              AS taxa,
       (SELECT count(*) FROM species)           AS species,
       (SELECT count(*) FROM sources)           AS sources,
       (SELECT count(*) FROM species_sources)   AS species_sources,
       (SELECT count(*) FROM countries)         AS countries,
       (SELECT count(*) FROM species_countries) AS species_countries,
       (SELECT count(*) FROM datasets)          AS datasets,
       (SELECT count(*) FROM occurrences)       AS occurrences,
       (SELECT count(*) FROM species_taxonomy)  AS species_taxonomy;
```

```text
-- result: setup-counts · 1 row · sha256 e3323c4c9cd8
taxa | species | sources | species_sources | countries | species_countries | datasets | occurrences | species_taxonomy
143 | 76 | 5 | 591 | 250 | 472 | 400 | 40395 | 76
```

### The PostGIS setup

The PostGIS labs run in schema `learn_curriculum`, which one file builds: `learn_curriculum.sql` (§4). Load it with `psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d <your database> -f learn_curriculum.sql`; it runs in one transaction, so a failed load leaves the previous schema as it was, and loading again replaces it. Every PostGIS lab starts with this session block. It puts `learn_curriculum` first on the search path, so plain table names find the lab tables, and PostGIS's functions still resolve from `public`. The tests run the same statement when they connect.

```sql
-- q: pg-session
-- status: ran
-- engine: postgis
SET search_path = learn_curriculum, public;
SHOW search_path;
```

```text
-- result: pg-session · 1 row · sha256 791623fd72db
search_path
learn_curriculum, public
```

A quick check that the load worked: the rows in every lab table.

```sql
-- q: pg-smoke
-- status: ran
-- engine: postgis
SELECT 'taxa' AS table_name, count(*) AS n_rows FROM taxa
UNION ALL SELECT 'species', count(*) FROM species
UNION ALL SELECT 'sources', count(*) FROM sources
UNION ALL SELECT 'species_sources', count(*) FROM species_sources
UNION ALL SELECT 'countries', count(*) FROM countries
UNION ALL SELECT 'species_countries', count(*) FROM species_countries
UNION ALL SELECT 'datasets', count(*) FROM datasets
UNION ALL SELECT 'occurrences', count(*) FROM occurrences
UNION ALL SELECT 'country_shapes', count(*) FROM country_shapes
UNION ALL SELECT 'admin1_shapes', count(*) FROM admin1_shapes
UNION ALL SELECT 'biomes', count(*) FROM biomes
UNION ALL SELECT 'ecoregions', count(*) FROM ecoregions
UNION ALL SELECT 'habitat_classes', count(*) FROM habitat_classes
UNION ALL SELECT 'country_habitats', count(*) FROM country_habitats
ORDER BY table_name;
```

```text
-- result: pg-smoke · 14 rows · sha256 444c9131da27
table_name | n_rows
admin1_shapes | 294
biomes | 14
countries | 250
country_habitats | 35
country_shapes | 247
… 9 more rows
```

Labs that create roles or schemas (d1, d5) clean up in the same block, so running a block twice, or stopping halfway through a module, leaves nothing behind. Their names start with `learn_`, and creating roles needs the CREATEROLE privilege (a superuser has it; on your own install, `ALTER ROLE <you> CREATEROLE` as the superuser, once). This check creates a read-only role, reads a table as that role, and removes it again: `DROP OWNED BY` takes away what the role was granted, and only then can `DROP ROLE` remove it.

```sql
-- q: pg-role-smoke
-- status: ran
-- engine: postgis
CREATE ROLE learn_smoke NOLOGIN;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA learn_curriculum TO learn_smoke;
GRANT SELECT ON species TO learn_smoke;
SET ROLE learn_smoke;
SELECT current_user AS role, count(*) AS species FROM species;
RESET ROLE;
DROP OWNED BY learn_smoke;
DROP ROLE learn_smoke;
SELECT count(*) AS learn_smoke_left FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'learn_smoke';
```

```text
-- result: pg-role-smoke · 1 row · sha256 fcfe7fd06dfa
learn_smoke_left
0
```

Most labs run in a transaction the tests roll back. The transaction labs (d4) manage their own, with `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`, exactly as you type them in `psql`; the tests then check that each one ended its transaction and left the lab tables as they were.

```sql
-- q: pg-tx-smoke
-- status: ran
-- engine: postgis
-- tx: own
BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE tx_smoke (id integer PRIMARY KEY);
INSERT INTO tx_smoke VALUES (1), (2);
ROLLBACK;
SELECT to_regclass('tx_smoke') IS NULL AS rolled_back;
```

```text
-- result: pg-tx-smoke · 1 row · sha256 a90c4cf411fd
rolled_back
true
```

### The Python setup

Python labs run in the `uv` environment (§3) and read the lab database through libpq's `PG*` environment variables, so the same file runs on your machine and on the test server. Every Python lab starts with this helper. It sets the search path when it connects, so plain table names find the lab tables in `learn_curriculum` and PostGIS's functions in `public`. It prints nothing.

```python
# q: py-connect
# status: ran
import psycopg


def connect():
    """A connection to the lab database: plain table names find learn_curriculum's tables, then PostGIS in public."""
    return psycopg.connect(options="-c search_path=learn_curriculum,public")
```

```text
-- result: py-connect · python · sha256 e3b0c44298fc
```

A quick check that the environment works: the search path through the helper, then the versions the labs were tested with.

```python
# q: py-smoke
# status: ran
# after: py-connect
import platform
from importlib.metadata import version

with connect() as conn:
    print("search_path:", conn.execute("SHOW search_path").fetchone()[0])
print("python:", platform.python_version())
for package in ["psycopg", "pandas", "pyarrow", "shapely", "pyproj", "pyogrio", "geopandas", "libpysal", "esda", "pointpats"]:
    print(f"{package}: {version(package)}")
```

```text

## A. The three spikes

Each spike ran on the VPS in the mission's spike folder, `/srv/critter-ai/agent-state/missions/critwire-learn-curriculum/spike/` (`SP` below; never committed). Its `README.md` lists every command in order; `verify.sh` re-runs them all.

### A.1 ETL: a GBIF download into PostGIS (S8, S9)

**Inputs.** The 73 `ids.gbif` in `data/species.json` (legacy GBIF Backbone keys); GBIF's occurrence download API with the owner's account; the lab loader (§0), which provides `countries`.

**The request** (`SP/downloads/gbif-request/request.json`): `TAXON_KEY in` the 73 keys, `LICENSE in [CC0_1_0, CC_BY_4_0]`, `HAS_COORDINATE`, `HAS_GEOSPATIAL_ISSUE = false`, `OCCURRENCE_STATUS = PRESENT`, `BASIS_OF_RECORD in` the 7 values critwire's countries rule allows, format `SIMPLE_CSV`. `checklistKey` is pinned to the legacy backbone at the top level and on `TAXON_KEY`; GBIF accepted it and echoes both in its stored request.

**Commands** (`SP/etl/run.sh <step>`, the spike's Python 3.12 environment, scripts run isolated with `-I`):

| Step | What it does | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `request` | builds the predicate, POSTs it, records the key and the `occurrence/search` count for the same filters | key `0041824-260928105237408`; search count 394,532 |
| `wait` | checks the status at most once a minute (resumable) | SUCCEEDED after 16 min 41 s |
| `fetch` | the zip, its sha256 and size; checks the echoed `checklistKey`s and `totalRecords` against the search count | 34.7 MB zip; DOI `10.15468/dl.fbpk9w`; 394,532 records (Δ 0) from 454 datasets |
| `load` | one transaction: `gbif_staging` (every column `text`) by `COPY … (FORMAT csv, DELIMITER E'\t', QUOTE E'\b', NULL '', HEADER true)` streamed from the zip, then the typed `occurrences_all`, then 10 checks that each roll the load back if any row fails | 394,532 rows in about 15 s; every check 0 |
| `datasets` | each dataset's title, publisher, DOI and license, and each publisher's name, at ≤ 2 requests a second | 454 datasets, 233 publishers, in 6 min |
| `sample` | the lab sample (below) → `occurrences.{parquet,csv}`, `datasets.csv` | 40,395 records, 400 datasets, 71 species |
| `verify` | offline, from the saved zip: `load` twice, then the sample into a temporary folder | same rows and md5 as the first load; every file's sha256 equal |

**What the spike found** (each changes the design, §4 and the modules say how):
- **Synonyms.** 4 of critwire's `ids.gbif` are synonyms in the backbone (Blanding's turtle, Baird's tapir, Temminck's and giant pangolins). GBIF files their 2,385 records under the accepted species' `speciesKey` and keeps our key in `taxonKey`. Rule: the species whose `ids.gbif` is the record's `speciesKey`, else its `taxonKey`; none, or two different species, fails. e2 teaches it.
- **Licenses.** One dataset (iNaturalist research-grade) holds records under two licenses, so `license` belongs on `occurrences`, not `datasets` (d2). 11 datasets declare CC BY-NC 4.0 while GBIF marks their 13,467 records CC0 or CC BY. The sample uses each record's **effective license**, the more restrictive of its own and its dataset's, and publishes only CC0 1.0 and CC BY 4.0 (§10 asks the owner to keep or change this).
- **Text-format `COPY` corrupts this file silently.** Loaded as `FORMAT text`, 9 rows with a backslash in free text change with no error; the csv form above keeps all 97 rows holding `\` or `"` byte for byte (e2).
- **Country codes.** All 112 codes in the download are `countries` rows; no `ZZ`, `XZ` or empty code reached it (the geospatial-issue filter removes them). The country-key contract still applies, for later refreshes.
- **Bias, in numbers.** 45 % of records give no coordinate uncertainty. Australia holds 189,551 of the 394,532 records and Brazil 101,791; one GPS-collar study supplies 134,690 jaguar fixes (s1).

**The sample.** Of 394,532 loaded records, 381,065 have an effective open license; at most 2,000 per species, chosen by ascending `md5` of the `gbifID` text, leaves **40,395 records** from 400 datasets: 28,187 CC BY 4.0 and 12,208 CC0 1.0. 13 species reach the cap; 33 have fewer than 100; the median is 111. Two species have none: the Ili pika (no open records at all) and the Yangtze giant softshell turtle (its one record is in a CC BY-NC dataset).

| File (`/learn/data/`) | Rows | Bytes |
|---|---|---|
| `occurrences.parquet` | 40,395 | 622,971 |
| `occurrences.csv` | 40,395 | 4,591,948 |
| `datasets.csv` | 400 | 72,797 |
| `postgis/learn_curriculum.sql` (all lab tables, with these two) | | 29,597,960 |

Every open record, uncapped, would be 4.8 MB as Parquet and 44.6 MB as CSV; it is never published (§4).

**Browser boot with the sample** (`SP/scripts/boot-time.ts`, desktop, 5 first visits): 3.22 s from navigation to a ready database, against 2.9 s to A1's first lesson result. The two new tables cost about 0.33 s of setup, so the whole setup can stay at boot.

**Evidence:** `SP/out/etl-postgis/` (`summary.md`, `sample.json`, `sample-contributions.json`, the two `verify-load-*.json`) and `SP/out/boot-time/`.
